# Capstone Project Proposal

Please complete this project proposal thoroughly so that your instructors can review it and have an intelligent conversation with you about requirements, scope, feasiblity, etc. Proposals will be due by the end of day on Friday before capstones start. If you don't have your idea fully fleshed out, complete the portions of this you can so that an instructor can help you flesh out the rest of your idea.

* [Requirements (flexible)](https://gist.github.com/matt-winzer/745abaadb509371dfee2a756c8da0c5e)

## Project Description
GamerFeed - A web app that is an amalgamation of top 5-10 game industry/related articles. 


## Problem Statement
This web app will help by speeding up the search process of specific game articles by bringing them all into one central location to filter through.


## How will your project solve this problem?
Bringing in gaming related articles from mutliple publishers such as Kotaku, PCGamer, IGN, Gamespot, etc.


## 5 user stories (at least):

* As a user, I can create an account (save for last!)
* As a user, the first thing I see is my dashboard with all articles populating the screen
* As a user, I can favorite an article to read later
* As a user, I can unfavorite and/or hide articles (possible stretch?)
* As a user, I can filter articles by search of publisher (kotaku, IGN, etc) or by game title

## STRETCH GOALS:
* Custom lists rather than just "Favorites" 
* User preferences that load upon sign in (preferences saved in DB, on sign in dashboard loads with JUST articles from Kotaku or IGN, etc)
* Filter by publisher AND game (i.e. Articles published by Kotaku related to Mario Kart)


## What technologies do you plan to use?

This does not need to be an exhaustive list. We want you to identify major technologies you will be using. This list may grow or shrink as your project progresses.

* VueJS
* Node/Express/Knex/bcrypt
* Maybe OAuth

## ERD - Entity Relationship Diagram

This does not need to be your absolute final ERD. We want you thinking about your data and how it might be related. Your ERD can be adjusted as your project progresses. 
* **You can draw it out & take a picture (quickest option) or use:**
* MY ERD -
